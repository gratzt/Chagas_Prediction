        Chagas disease is caused by the parasite *Trypanosoma cruzi* and is primarily transmitted by 
        infected triatomine bugs. It's endemic in Latin America but has spread to other regions due to migration.

        Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This tool demonstrates how deep learning 
        can potentially assist in screening for this neglected tropical disease using ECG data.
